# CodeCrafterRL: Reinforcement Learning-Assisted Compiler Autotuning

Welcome to **CodeCrafterRL**, an open-source research project designed to explore **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** for **automatic compiler flag tuning** across benchmarks in the [PolyBench suite](https://github.com/stefanocereda/polybench_data). This project leverages Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to learn optimal compiler configurations that minimize execution time for a given benchmark.

## üöÄ Features

- üß† **Reinforcement Learning environment** using OpenAI Gym API
- ‚öôÔ∏è RL agent (DQN) trained to select compiler flags
- üìä Execution time prediction using Nearest Neighbors and heuristic fallback
- üìà Reward curves plotted and saved for performance analysis


# Alternate RL Model & LOOCV (Leave-One-Out Cross Validation)

This directory contains advanced reinforcement learning (RL) models for compiler optimization, with a focus on the expanded features DQN agent, which has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance.

## Overview

- **alt_rl_model/**: Implements RL agents (notably DQN) for optimizing compiler flags using benchmark data. Includes environments, data preprocessors, training scripts, and analysis tools.
- **loocv/**: Implements Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV) for the expanded features DQN agent, testing generalization by excluding a benchmark from training and evaluating on it.

## Why Expanded Features DQN?

**The expanded features DQN agent is the best model.**

- **100% Success Rate:** All 24 benchmarks optimized successfully!
- **Average Improvement:** 21.25% (vs previous ~16%)
- **Best Performance:** Up to 47.98% improvement on `network_patricia`
- **Top Performers:**
  - `network_patricia`: 47.98% improvement
  - `security_sha`: 42.21% improvement
  - `office_stringsearch1`: 35.11% improvement
  - `automotive_susan_s`: 32.62% improvement
  - `telecom_adpcm_c`: 31.38% improvement
- **Key:** The 279 additional static features (code characteristics, memory access, basic block info, branch prediction) allow the model to make much more informed optimization decisions.

## How to Run

### 1. Train the Expanded Features DQN Agent

```bash
cd alt_rl_model
python train_unified_alt_rl.py
```
- Trains the DQN agent using all benchmarks and expanded features.
- Model weights saved as `unified_alt_dqn_agent.pth`.

### 2. Test/Evaluate the Trained Model

```bash
python test_model.py
```
- Evaluates the trained model on all benchmarks.
- Prints summary statistics and saves results/plots.

### 3. Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOOCV)

#### a. Train with LOOCV (excluding `security_sha`):
```bash
cd loocv
python loocv_trainer.py
```
- Trains the expanded features DQN agent on all benchmarks except `security_sha`.
- Evaluates on the excluded benchmark.
- Saves model and results in the `loocv/` directory.

#### b. Additional Testing (Optional):
```bash
python loocv_tester.py
```
- Loads the LOOCV-trained model and runs further evaluation on `security_sha`.
