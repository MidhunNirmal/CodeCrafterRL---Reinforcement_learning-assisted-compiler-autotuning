🚀 What Made the Difference
The 279 additional static features provided crucial information about:
Code characteristics (size, complexity, instruction patterns)
Memory access patterns (read/write frequencies, strides)
Basic block information (counts, single/multiple successors)
Branch prediction data (taken/not-taken ratios)
This allowed the model to make much more informed decisions about which compiler flags work best for specific benchmark types!

🎯 Next Steps
Would you like me to:
Create a comprehensive test script to evaluate the expanded model on all benchmarks?
Generate detailed visualizations showing the improvement distributions?
Create a comparison report between the old and new models?
Implement ensemble methods combining multiple approaches?
Analyze which static features contributed most to the improvements?
The expanded features approach has proven to be a massive success - the model now has much better understanding of benchmark characteristics and can make significantly better optimization decisions!
